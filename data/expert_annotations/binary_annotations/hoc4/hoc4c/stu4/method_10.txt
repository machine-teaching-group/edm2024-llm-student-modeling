You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

--- Target Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 shows several misconceptions and misunderstandings. Here are some observations:

The student has repeated the "moveForward" command three times in a row without turning, which means the avatar would crash into the wall.
After turning left, the student has moved forward again without checking if there is a wall or not, which would result in another crash.
The student has turned right before reaching the goal, which is incorrect because the avatar should turn right after moving forward to the goal.
The last "moveForward" command is unnecessary and would cause the avatar to move past the goal.
Based on these observations, it seems like the student has difficulty understanding the concept of turning and navigating around walls. They also appear to lack patience and tend to rush through the movements without properly planning ahead.

Now, let's synthesize an attempt code for the target task 1 that reflects the student's behavior and misconceptions. Here's one possible attempt code:

def Run(){
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
}

In this attempt code, the student has repeated the "moveForward" command twice without turning, which would lead to a collision with the wall. Then, they have turned left but immediately moved forward again without checking for obstacles. After turning right, they have moved forward twice instead of once, which would make the avatar overshoot the goal. Finally, they have turned left again, perhaps thinking that it would correct their mistake, but it would actually make things worse.

Overall, this attempt code demonstrates similar patterns of mistakes and misconceptions as the previous attempt code, indicating that the student still struggles with navigation and spatial reasoning.
