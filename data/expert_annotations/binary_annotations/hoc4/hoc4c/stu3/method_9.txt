You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/. 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

In this task, we want you to analyze the student's behavior and misconceptions in their attempt at the reference task and then use that information to synthesize a new attempt code for the target task that reflects the student's behavior and misconceptions.

The reference task is a simple maze-solving problem where the agent needs to move forward and turn to navigate through the maze. The student's attempt code has some mistakes; they turn right instead of left after moving forward the first time and repeat the same mistake later. Also, they turn left twice in a row, which isn't necessary.

Based on this analysis, we would expect the student's attempt code for the target task to have similar mistakes. They might still struggle with correctly navigating through the maze, turning left or right when they shouldn't, or repeating unnecessary actions.

Therefore, your goal is to provide a plausible attempt code for the target task that exhibits
