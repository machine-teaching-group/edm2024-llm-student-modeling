You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

--- Target Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
In the student's attempt for the reference task, they appeared to be overcompensating with their turns. The student inserted extra turns even when not necessary, seemingly leading the Avatar in a circle before moving forward.

For the target task, given the student's previous behavior, an attempt might likely look something like this:

```python
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnRight
	turnLeft
	turnRight
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	turnLeft
	turnRight
	moveForward
}
```

Here, the student is maintaining the pattern of unnecessary turns they demonstrated in the reference task. They start with a move-forward function followed by right and left turns before moving forward again. The student then executes two left turns and a right turn, appearing to bring the avatar in a circle prior to moving forward (even though none of these are necessary in the solution). The extra turning operations seem to be a pattern of creating an unnecessary circular movement before any forward movement.
