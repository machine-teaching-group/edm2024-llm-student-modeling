You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Great, let's dive into the tasks and analyze the student's attempt for Target Task 1.
Reference Task 1:
The student's solution code for this task is:
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward

}
Observations:

The student has correctly used the moveForward and turnRight blocks to move the avatar towards the goal.
The student has used the turnRight block twice, which is unnecessary as the avatar will automatically turn right when it reaches the wall.
The student has not used the turnLeft block, which means the avatar will not be able to turn left and will continue moving straight.
Target Task 1:
The student's attempt for this task is:
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
}
Observations:

The student has correctly used the moveForward and turnLeft blocks to move the avatar towards the goal.
The student has used the turnLeft block twice, which is unnecessary as the avatar will automatically turn left when it reaches the wall.
The student has not used the turnRight block, which means the avatar will not be able to turn right and will continue moving straight.
Misconceptions:

Based on the student's attempt, it seems that they are struggling with the following misconceptions:

The student is not understanding the concept of turning. They are using the turnLeft and turnRight blocks unnecessarily, which can lead to incorrect movements of the avatar.
The student is not using the moveForward block correctly. They are using it only once, which means the avatar will not move forward continuously.
The student is not paying attention to the wall cells. They are not using the turnLeft and turnRight blocks when the avatar reaches a wall, which can lead to the avatar crashing into the wall.
To help the student improve, we can provide feedback and suggestions, such as:

Emphasize the importance of using the turnLeft and
