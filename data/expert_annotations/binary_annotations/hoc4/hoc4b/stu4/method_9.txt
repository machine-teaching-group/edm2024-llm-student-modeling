You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/. 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

The above code contains two tasks, reference task 1 (grid) and target task 1 (grid). The reference task has one solution which is `moveForward turnLeft moveForward turnRight moveForward`. A student attempted the reference task but did not follow the correct path. They moved forward four times before turning left, then moved forward three more times without turning.

Your job is to simulate how the student would complete the target task (grid) based on their behavior and misconceptions from the reference task. Then provide a description of what happened in both tasks and why the student failed in the reference task. Also, describe what will happen if the student runs their code for the target task. 

You can assume that the grid size is fixed at 10x10.

Please submit your answer as a .txt file containing the simulated student attempt code for the target task, a brief description of what happened in both tasks, and why the student
