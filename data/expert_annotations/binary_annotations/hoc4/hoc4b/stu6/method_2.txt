You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){

}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Based on the student's behavior and misconceptions in the reference attempt, the student does not seem to understand how the orientation of the character affects movement and turning. They executed "moveForward" commands more often than necessary and made numerous turns in different directions without apparent insight into their actual orientation. They're also turning around in circles quite a bit, indicating they may not completely understand how to navigate the 2D plane.

Considering the student's misconceptions and behavior, their attempt on the target task might look something like this:

```python
def Run(){
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	turnRight
	turnRight
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	turnRight
	turnLeft
	turnRight
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnRight
	turnLeft
	turnRight
	moveForward
}
```
In this attempt, similar to the reference task, they turn right and left unnecessarily before every move. The student might tend to repeat unnecessary turns instead of focusing on the direction they should take based on the AVATAR's current position and orientation. Also, they would make more "moveForward" commands than necessary, similar to the reference task.
