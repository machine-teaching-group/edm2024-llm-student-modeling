You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Great, let's dive into the task!
Reference Task 1:
The student's attempt code for the reference task is:
def Run(){
moveForward
turnLeft
moveForward
turnRight
turnRight
turnLeft
turnRight
moveForward
}

The student's behavior and misconceptions in this attempt are:

The student starts by calling the moveForward block without checking if the AVATAR is at a FREE cell. This is a misconception, as the AVATAR should only move between FREE cells.
The student then calls the turnLeft block without checking if the AVATAR is facing the correct direction. This is a misconception, as the turnLeft block should only be called when the AVATAR is facing East.
The student then calls the moveForward block again without checking if the AVATAR has moved to a FREE cell. This is a misconception, as the AVATAR should only move to a FREE cell after turning.
The student then calls the turnRight block without checking if the AVATAR is at a FREE cell. This is a misconception, as the turnRight block should only be called when the AVATAR is at a FREE cell.
The student then calls the moveForward block again without checking if the AVATAR has moved to the GOAL cell. This is a misconception, as the AVATAR should only move to the GOAL cell after turning.
Target Task 1:
The student's attempt code for the target task is:
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	turnRight
	turnLeft
	turnRight
	moveForward
}

The student's behavior and misconceptions in this attempt are:

The student starts by calling the moveForward block without checking if the AVATAR is at a FREE cell. This is a misconception, as the AVATAR should only move between FREE cells.
The student then calls the turnLeft block without checking if the AVATAR is facing the correct direction. This is a misconception,
