You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

--- Reference Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){

	moveForward

def Run(){
	moveForward

	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	turnRight
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 is incorrect because it misses the last "turn Right" command needed to reach the goal cell. It seems the student misunderstands how the avatar moves and doesn't fully understand the grid layout. They keep moving forward without considering any obstacles or the need to change directions.

Based on this observation, we can predict that the student's attempt for the target task 1 might have similar issues. Here's what their attempt code might look like:

def Run(){
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
}

Explanation:
The student will likely continue to move forward without checking for obstacles or changing directions. They won't turn right after moving forward twice because they don't understand the importance of that action. This attempt code will not solve the target task since it won't guide the avatar towards the goal cell.
