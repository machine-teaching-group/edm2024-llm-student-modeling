You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	turnRight
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 is incomplete and incorrect. The student has only moved the avatar forward twice and turned left once, which will not bring the avatar to the goal.

The student seems to have misunderstood the concept of loops and conditional statements. They have not used any loops or conditionals in their code, and instead have repeated the same actions multiple times. This suggests that the student may not fully understand how to use these concepts to solve problems.

Additionally, the student has also missed the fact that the avatar needs to turn right after moving forward three times. This indicates that the student may not have fully understood the problem statement or the desired outcome.

Now, let's synthesize an attempt code for the target task 1 that reflects the student's behavior and misconceptions shown in the reference task. Here's what the attempt code might look like:

def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
}

In this attempt code, the student has repeated the same actions as in the reference task, but with slight variations. They have added an extra turn left at the end, which will make the avatar face south instead of west. This shows that the student still struggles with understanding the directions and movements of the avatar.

Furthermore, the student has again failed to include any loops or conditionals in their code, suggesting that they still need help grasping these concepts. Overall, this attempt code demonstrates the student's continued struggle with programming concepts and problem-solving strategies.
