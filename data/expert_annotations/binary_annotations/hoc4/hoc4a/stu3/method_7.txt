You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	turnRight
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnRight
	turnLeft

	moveForward

	moveForward
}

The student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code for the reference task include:

* The student does not understand the difference between moveForward and turn commands. They have used turn commands unnecessarily, which will cause the agent to change direction but not move forward.
* The student has also used turnLeft and turnRight commands in an incorrect order. In the attempt code, they first turn left and then right, which will make the agent move backward instead of turning.
* The student seems to lack understanding of how to navigate around obstacles. In the attempt code, they try to move forward into a wall (cell 5), which will cause the agent to crash.

Based on these observations, we can expect the student's attempt code for the target task to show similar misconceptions and behaviors. For example, they may still confuse moveForward and turn commands or fail to properly navigate around obstacles. The attempted code could look something like this
