You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	turnRight
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 shows several misconceptions and misunderstandings. Here are some observations:

The student has repeated the "moveForward" command multiple times without realizing that the avatar can only move forward once per turn. This indicates that the student does not fully understand the game rules or the avatar's capabilities.
The student has also turned left twice, which is unnecessary and incorrect since the avatar already faces east after moving forward three times. This suggests that the student may not have fully understood the concept of turning and its effects on the avatar's orientation.
Lastly, the student has failed to reach the goal cell, indicating that they may not have fully grasped the objective of the game or how to plan their moves effectively.
Now, let's synthesize an attempt code for the target task 1, assuming the student has made similar mistakes. Here's what the attempt code might look like:

def Run(){
	turnRight
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward
}

Explanation:

The student may still have difficulty understanding the game rules, so they might repeat the "moveForward" command multiple times again.
They may also struggle with turning, as seen in the reference task, and turn left unnecessarily.
Additionally, the student may not have realized that the goal cell is located upwards and to the right, so they might not have planned their moves accordingly. Instead, they might simply move forward repeatedly, hoping to reach the goal eventually.
Overall, this attempt code reflects the student's persistent misconceptions and lack of understanding regarding the game mechanics and objectives.
