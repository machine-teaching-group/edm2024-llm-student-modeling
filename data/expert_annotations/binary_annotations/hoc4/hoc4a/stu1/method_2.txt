You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	turnRight
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Based on the student's behavior and misconceptions observed in the reference task attempt, the student seems to have an understanding of using basic navigation blocks but fails to correctly grasp the spatial logic in the navigation of the avatar, as evidenced by the incorrect order of turning right and left. 

In the reference task, the student was supposed to turn left first, then right. Instead, they turned right first and then left. This suggests the student has issues understanding the directionality of the 'turn' commands, perhaps confusing the avatar's perspective with their own.

As for the target task, given the same student's behavior, their attempt might look something like the following:

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---

def Run(){
    turnLeft
	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward
}

In this code, they would make the same mistake as in the reference task, swapping the order of the 'turnRight' and 'turnLeft' commands. This reflects the consistent misconception observed in the reference task, where the student's attempt tends to confuse the directions of turn commands in relation to the avatar's perspective.
