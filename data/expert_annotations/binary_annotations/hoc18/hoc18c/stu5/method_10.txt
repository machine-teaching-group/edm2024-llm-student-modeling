You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathAhead){
			moveForward

}

--- Reference Task 1: Student attempt ---
def Run(){
	moveForward
	If(pathAhead){
		moveForward

	Else{
		turnLeft

}

--- Target Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathLeft){
			turnLeft
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 is as follows:

def Run(){
	moveForward
	If(pathAhead){
		moveForward
	}
	Else{
		turnLeft
	}
}

The student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code are:

The student has not used any loops or conditionals in their code, which means they are not able to handle situations where the avatar needs to move repeatedly or make decisions based on the environment.
The student has used the "moveForward" block outside of any loop or conditional, which means that the avatar will move forward infinitely, regardless of the environment.
The student has used the "turnLeft" block inside the "Else" block, which means that the avatar will turn left whenever it encounters a wall, instead of moving forward.
Now, let's synthesize an attempt code for the target task 1 that captures the student's behavior and misconceptions:

def Run(){
	moveForward
	If(pathAhead){
		moveForward
	}
	Else{
		turnLeft
	}
	If(pathLeft){
		turnLeft
		moveForward
	}
}

In this attempt code, the student has added an additional "If" statement to check for the presence of a path to the left. However, they have not used any loops or conditionals to handle situations where the avatar needs to move repeatedly or make decisions based on the environment. Additionally, the student has used the "turnLeft" block inside the "Else" block, which means that the avatar will turn left whenever it encounters a wall, instead of moving forward.

Overall, the student's attempt code for the target task 1 demonstrates the same misconceptions and behavior as their attempt code for the reference task 1. The student has not yet learned how to use loops and conditionals effectively to solve the maze challenge.
