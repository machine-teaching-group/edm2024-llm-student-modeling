You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathLeft){

		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Sure, I'll do my best to explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code for the reference task, and then simulate a similar attempt for the target task.
Reference Task 1: Student attempt
The student's code for the reference task is:
def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathAhead){
			turnLeft
		}
		Else{
			turnLeft
		}
		moveForward
	}
}
Behavior and misconceptions:

The student is using RepeatUntil(goal) to repeat the block until the goal is reached, but they are not using the goal variable correctly. They are checking the pathAhead variable instead of the goal variable, which is the actual target of the RepeatUntil block.
The student is using turnLeft and turnRight blocks to navigate the maze, but they are not using the moveForward block to move the avatar forward after turning. This results in the avatar getting stuck in the wall.
The student is not using the If blocks correctly. They are using If(pathAhead) instead of If(goal) which is the correct condition to check for reaching the goal.
Target Task 1: Student attempt
Now, I will simulate a student's attempt for the target task based on the behavior and misconceptions observed in the reference task:

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(pathAhead){
		If(pathLeft){
			turnLeft
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			turnLeft
		}
		moveForward
	}
}
In this attempt, the student is still using RepeatUntil(pathAhead) instead of RepeatUntil(goal), and they are checking the pathLeft variable instead of the goal variable. They are also using turnLeft and moveForward blocks correctly this time, but they are still checking the pathLeft variable instead of the goal variable.
To summarize, the student's behavior and mis
