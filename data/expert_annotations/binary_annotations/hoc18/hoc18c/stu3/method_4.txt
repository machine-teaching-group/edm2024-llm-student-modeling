You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/. 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

Please try again! The student attempted to solve the target task but made several mistakes. Can you identify them?

The student tried to simulate the reference task’s behavior by creating an attempt code that looks similar at first glance, but there are some crucial differences:

In the student attempt, the actor moves left instead of right after seeing the “+” symbol in the reference task.
In the student attempt, the actor turns left after moving forward in the reference task, while in the reference task, they turn right.
These mistakes show that the student did not fully understand the mechanics of the reference task or the reasoning behind their actions. To improve their understanding, it may be helpful for them to analyze the reference task more closely and practice running it multiple times to internalize the correct movements.
