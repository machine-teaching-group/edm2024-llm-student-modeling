You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathLeft){
			turnLeft
			moveForward

		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Based on the student's misunderstanding demonstrated in the Reference Task 1, the student does not seem to grasp the concept of conditionals properly. Observing the student's code, they have used the same action 'turnLeft' for both if there's a path ahead and if there's not. 

This tells us that the student's misconception is using the same operation for both the 'if' and 'else' condition. The student has also placed 'moveForward' after the conditional statement, showing they are not aware that this could make the avatar move forward regardless of the conditions defined above it.

So, taking into account the same student behavior and misconceptions that arose in the first task, an attempt that the student might make for the Target Task 1 could look something like this:

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
```python
def Run(){
    RepeatUntil(goal){
        If(pathLeft){
            turnLeft
        }
        Else{
            turnLeft
        }
        moveForward
    }
}
```
Here, the student keeps the same pattern of 'turnLeft' for both conditions and calls 'moveForward' at the end, inconsistent with the conditional statement. This will not solve the task effectively, but it carries forward the student's misconceptions from the reference task.
