You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathAhead){

--- Reference Task 1: Student attempt ---
def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathAhead){

		Else{
			turnLeft

		moveForward
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathLeft){
			turnLeft
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 is as follows:

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathAhead){
			turnLeft
		}
		Else{
			turnLeft
		}
		moveForward
	}
}

The student's attempt code has several misconceptions and errors:

Infinite Loop: The student's code has an infinite loop because the RepeatUntil block repeating condition is always true (goal is always true). This will cause the program to run indefinitely.
Redundant Code: The student has written redundant code by using both turnLeft and moveForward in the else block. This is not necessary, as the avatar will already have moved forward when it turned left.
Lack of Understanding of Boolean Conditions: The student has used pathAhead boolean condition in the if statement, but it is not defined in the code. Moreover, the student has not used the pathLeft boolean condition, which is necessary to check if the avatar can move left.
Lack of Understanding of Loops: The student has not used the RepeatUntil block correctly. The RepeatUntil block should be used to repeat a set of actions until a certain condition is met. In this case, the student has used it to repeat an action indefinitely.
Now, based on the student's behavior and misconceptions in the reference task, we can predict how they might approach the target task. Here's a possible attempt code that the student might write for the target task:

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathAhead){
			turnLeft
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			turnLeft
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

The student's attempt code for the target task has the following misconceptions and errors:

Redundant Code: The student has written redundant code by using both turnLeft and moveForward in both the if and else blocks. This is not necessary, as the avatar will already have moved forward when it turned left.
Lack of Understanding of Boolean Conditions: The student has used pathAhead boolean condition in the if statement, but it is not defined in the code. Moreover, the student has not used the pathLeft boolean condition, which is necessary to check
