You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

		If(pathLeft){
			turnLeft
			moveForward

		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Based on the provided reference task and the student's attempt, it's clear that the student is trying to solve the maze challenge but has some misconceptions and is not following the correct logic. Here's an analysis of the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code for the reference task:

Reference Task 1: Student attempt

```python
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
}
```

1. **Lack of Conditional Statements**: The most significant misconception is that the student's code lacks conditional statements (If and Else). In the reference solution, the AVATAR is supposed to move forward if there is a path ahead (pathAhead), but the student's code simply consists of a sequence of moveForward and turnLeft commands without any checks.

2. **Repeated Actions**: The student seems to think that repeatedly moving forward and turning left will lead to a solution. This is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the maze's structure, and the AVATAR might hit walls or move in circles indefinitely.

3. **Ignoring the Goal Condition**: The goal condition (RepeatUntil(goal)) is not implemented in the student's code. In the reference solution, the AVATAR should keep moving until it reaches the goal, but the student's code doesn't incorporate this logic.

Now, let's synthesize an attempt code for the new target task, imagining that the student still has similar misconceptions:

Target Task 1: Student attempt (Hypothetical)

```python
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
}
```

In this hypothetical student attempt for the new target task, we see that the student has not corrected their misconceptions. They are still using a repetitive sequence of moveForward and turnLeft commands without any conditional statements. This code is unlikely to solve the maze because it doesn't consider the maze's layout, and the AVATAR will likely hit walls or move in circles without reaching the goal.
