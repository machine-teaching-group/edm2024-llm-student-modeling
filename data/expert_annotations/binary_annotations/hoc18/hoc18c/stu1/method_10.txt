You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathLeft){
			turnLeft
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 is incorrect because it turns right instead of left when there is no path ahead. This indicates that the student misunderstands the turnLeft block and its purpose.

For the target task 1, the student attempt is likely to be as follows:

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathAhead){
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			turnRight
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

This attempt is incorrect because it turns right instead of left when there is no path ahead, similar to the mistake in the reference task 1. Additionally, it includes an extra moveForward block inside the else clause, which will cause the avatar to move forward unnecessarily and potentially crash into walls.

The correct solution for the target task 1 is:

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathLeft){
			turnLeft
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

This solution checks if there is a path to the left, and if so, turns left and moves forward. Otherwise, it simply moves forward. This will successfully guide the avatar to the goal cell while avoiding walls.
