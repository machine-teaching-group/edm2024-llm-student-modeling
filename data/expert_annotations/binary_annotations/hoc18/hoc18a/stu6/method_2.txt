You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Based on the student's behavior observed in the Reference Task 1, they seem to prefer an incremental approach over using conditionals or boolean functions. They hardcoded each movement step by step without using the provided booleans or the RepeatUntil loop. They might misunderstand the use-case of these concepts, thus avoiding them. Thus, ignoring the booleans and loops, we need to create an approach similar to the student.

Given that the go-to strategy of the student involves manually dictating moves for the avatar on the grid sequentially, an expected attempt would look as follows:

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
```python
def Run(){
    turnLeft
    moveForward
    moveForward
    moveForward
    turnRight
    moveForward
    moveForward
    moveForward
    moveForward
}
```
The exact movements would depend on how the student interpreted the task, but it is likely they would follow a direct approach as shown. The student's misconception is that they typically don't employ any conditionals or loops, but instead rely on a sequential navigation approach to reach the goal. The lack of Repeat Until loops or If statements in their code is a noteworthy characteristic of their coding style.
