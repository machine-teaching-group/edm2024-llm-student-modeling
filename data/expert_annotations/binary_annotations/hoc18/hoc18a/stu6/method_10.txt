You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt code for the reference task is attempting to solve the maze by simply moving forward and turning left without any regard for the availability of paths or the goal. This is evident in the way the student has repeated the moveForward and turnLeft commands multiple times without any conditional statements to check for the path ahead or the goal.

The student attempt code for the target task is similar to the reference task, with the student attempting to solve the maze by moving forward and turning left without any regard for the availability of paths or the goal. However, the student has added a few additional commands, such as moveForward and turnLeft, which are not necessary for solving the maze.

It seems that the student has not understood the concept of using conditional statements to check for the path ahead and the goal, and is instead relying on repetitive movements to try and solve the maze. The student also appears to be unaware of the availability of the repeatUntil block, which would allow them to repeat a set of commands until a certain condition is met, such as the goal being reached.

To synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, we can start with the reference task attempt code and modify it to fit the target task. We can add some unnecessary commands, such as moveForward and turnLeft, and repeat some of the commands multiple times. We can also remove some of the conditional statements to check for the path ahead and the goal, and instead rely on repetitive movements to try and solve the maze.

Here is an example of an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student for the target task:

def Run(){
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
}

This code attempts to solve the maze by moving forward and turning left without any regard for the availability of paths or the goal. The student has repeated some of the commands multiple times, and has not used any conditional statements to check for the path ahead or the goal.
