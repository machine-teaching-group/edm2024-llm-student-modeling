You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

--- Reference Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathAhead){
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			turnLeft
		}
	}
}

--- Reference Task 1: Student attempt ---
def Run(){
	moveForward
	If(pathAhead){
		moveForward
	}
	Else{
		turnLeft
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathRight){
			turnRight
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Based on the student's previous actions and misconceptions shown in the reference task attempt, the student would likely make similar mistakes in the target task. Given this, the student attempt for the target task might look like:

--- Target Task 1: Student Attempt ---
def Run(){
	moveForward
	If(pathRight){
		moveForward
	}
	Else{
		turnLeft
	}
} 

In this attempt, the student again disregards the use of loops to continue their code until a condition (reaching the goal) is met. They also have a misconception on how to use the blocks for conditional statements, as they demonstrate only once the use of moveForward inside the if(pathRight) condition instead of incorporating it with a turnRight operation for a more effective navigation. Finally, like in the reference task, they also use turnLeft in the else part, ignoring the probability of also having a path to the right.
