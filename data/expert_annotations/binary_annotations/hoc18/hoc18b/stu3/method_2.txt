You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathRight){
			turnRight
			moveForward

		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Based on the student's attempt on Reference Task 1, it seems the student has a misconception on how the program should deal with conditions, specifically, their use of 'turnLeft' in both 'if' and 'else' part shows misunderstanding on toggling between different actions based on conditions. Additionally, their 'moveForward' command is outside the condition logic, meaning it will be executed even when there's no path ahead, leading to a potential crash.

Considering these misconceptions, the student's attempt to solve the Target Task 1 might look like this:

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---

```python
def Run(){
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathRight){
			turnLeft
		}
		Else{
			turnLeft
		}
		moveForward
	}
}
```
This synthesis assumes that the student will interpret the 'avatar facing right' as 'pathRight' and continue to use the 'turnLeft' action in both 'if' and 'else' parts of the conditional, regardless of the situation. Also, the 'moveForward' command continues to be outside the condition, risking a crash when the path is not clear.
