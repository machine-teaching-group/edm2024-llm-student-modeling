You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathRight){
			turnRight

			moveForward

	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Great, let's dive into the task!
--- Reference Task 1: Grid ---
The grid consists of 10 rows and 10 columns, with walls, goal, and avatar locations. The avatar is located at (5, 5) facing east. The student's attempt code is given below.
--- Reference Task 1: Student attempt ---
def Run(){
RepeatUntil(goal){
If(pathAhead){
turnLeft
}
Else{
turnLeft
}
}
}

Now, let's analyze the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code:

The student starts by using RepeatUntil(goal), which is the correct block to use for navigating through the maze.
The student then checks pathAhead and pathLeft conditions. This is a good start, as these conditions will help the avatar move towards the goal. However, the student ONLY checks pathAhead and does not check pathLeft, which means the avatar will only move forward and will not turn left when it should.
The student turns left when pathAhead is true, but this is incorrect. The student should turn left when pathLeft is true.
The student moves forward when pathAhead is true, but this is incorrect. The student should move forward when pathLeft is true.
The student does not check for the goal location, and the code will continue to repeat until the goal is reached.
--- Target Task 1: Grid ---
The target task grid is similar to the reference task grid, with some minor modifications. The student's attempt code for the target task is given below.
--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
def Run(){
RepeatUntil(goal){
If(pathAhead){
turnLeft
}
Else{
turnLeft
}
moveForward
}
}

Now, let's analyze the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code for the target task:

The student starts by using RepeatUntil(goal), which is
