You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathLeft){
			turnLeft
			moveForward

		Else{
			moveForward

}

	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt code for the reference task 1 has a few misconceptions and errors.

The student has used a repeat until loop, but the condition for the loop is not properly defined. The student has used "goal" as the condition, but it should be "pathAhead" or "pathLeft" depending on the situation.
The student has used "pathLeft" as the condition for turning left, but it should be "pathAhead" to check if there is a path ahead before turning left.
The student has used "moveForward" twice in a row, which is not necessary and can cause the avatar to move past the goal cell.
The attempt code for the target task 1 is likely to be similar to the student attempt code for the reference task 1, with the same misconceptions and errors. Here's an example of what the student attempt code for the target task 1 might look like:

def Run(){
RepeatUntil(goal){
If(pathLeft){
turnLeft
moveForward
}
Else{
moveForward
}
}
}

This code has the same issues as the student attempt code for the reference task 1:

The condition for the repeat until loop is not properly defined.
The student has used "pathLeft" as the condition for turning left, but it should be "pathAhead" to check if there is a path ahead before turning left.
The student has used "moveForward" twice in a row, which is not necessary and can cause the avatar to move past the goal cell.
Therefore, the synthesized attempt code for the target task 1 is likely to be similar to the student attempt code for the reference task 1, with the same misconceptions and errors.
