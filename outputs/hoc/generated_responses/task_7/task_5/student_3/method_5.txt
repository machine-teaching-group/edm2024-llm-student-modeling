You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student appears to have some misunderstandings regarding the use of loops and conditionals. They are manually providing the steps for navigating the avatar through the maze instead of letting the program decide the action based on the situation (path ahead, path to the left, etc.). The student's code lacks the use of 'RepeatUntil', 'If', and 'Else' constructs to handle varying maze configurations. They seem to be trying to predict the course rather than to create a solution that assesses the current situation to make a decision.

Given the student's misconception shown in the reference task, the student might approach the target task in a similar predictive manner. Here might be a plausible code attempt, following their style of explicitly defining all movements without use of conditional statements or loops:

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
```python
def Run(){
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward
	moveForward
}
```
This code, like the first attempt, tries to navigate the maze step-by-step, without considering different configurations or using repeat and condition blocks to deal with dynamic paths.
