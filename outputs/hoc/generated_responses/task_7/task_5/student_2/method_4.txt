You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathAhead){
			moveForward

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){

--- Target Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathRight){
			turnRight
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
In the reference task, the student's attempt code is as follows:

```python
def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathAhead){
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			turnRight
		}
	}
}
```

Let's analyze the student's behavior and misconceptions in this attempt code:

1. **Misconception about Turning**: In the reference solution, the avatar turns left when there's no path ahead. However, in the student's attempt, the avatar turns right when there's no path ahead. This indicates a misunderstanding of the correct turning behavior.

2. **Lack of Initial Movement**: The reference solution begins with two `moveForward` commands before entering the loop. This ensures that the avatar moves forward from its starting position. However, the student's attempt lacks these initial movements, which means the avatar won't move forward from its initial position before entering the loop.

Now, let's synthesize an attempt code for the new target task that captures the student's behavior and misconceptions:

```python
def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathRight){
			turnRight
		}
		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}
```

In this synthesized attempt, the student continues to exhibit the misconception of turning right instead of left when there's no path ahead, as seen in the reference task. Additionally, the student does not include any initial movements, so the avatar won't move forward from its starting position before entering the loop, just like in the previous attempt.

Please note that this is a simplified attempt and does not fully address the correct solution for the target task, but it replicates the student's misconceptions observed in the reference task.
