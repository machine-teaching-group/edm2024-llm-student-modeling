You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

--- Reference Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathAhead){
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			turnLeft
		}
	}
}

--- Reference Task 1: Student attempt ---
def Run(){
	moveForward
	If(pathAhead){
		moveForward
	}
	Else{
		turnLeft
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathRight){
			turnRight
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 contains several misconceptions and errors.

The student has not used any loops or conditionals in their code, which means they are not able to handle complex situations that require repeated movements or decision-making.
The student has used the "moveForward" block twice in a row, which will cause the avatar to move two cells forward instead of just one.
The student has used the "turnLeft" block in the else statement of the if-else clause, which will cause the avatar to turn left even if there is no wall ahead.
The student has not checked for the goal condition, which means the avatar will not stop moving even after reaching the goal cell.
Based on these observations, it is likely that the student will make similar mistakes in their attempt at the target task 1. Therefore, a synthesized attempt code that captures the student's behavior and misconceptions could be:

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
def Run(){
moveForward
moveForward
If(pathAhead){
moveForward
}
Else{
turnLeft
}
}

This code contains the same errors and misconceptions as the student's attempt at the reference task 1. The student has not used any loops or conditionals, and has used the "moveForward" block twice in a row. Additionally, the student has used the "turnLeft" block in the else statement of the if-else clause, which will cause the avatar to turn left even if there is no wall ahead.
