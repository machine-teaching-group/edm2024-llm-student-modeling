You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathRight){
			turnRight
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Great, let's dive into the task and analyze the student's attempt code.
Reference Task 1:
The student's attempt code is almost correct, but there are a few misconceptions:

The student uses moveForward instead of move in the Else block. This is not a problem in this case, as moveForward is the correct command to move the avatar forward. However, this mistake could lead to errors in more complex tasks where different commands are required.
The student does not use RepeatUntil correctly. In the Else block, the student uses RepeatUntil(goal) instead of RepeatUntil(pathRight). pathRight is the correct condition to check for, as it indicates when the avatar is next to the goal cell.
Target Task 1:
The student's attempt code for the target task is significantly different from the solution code. Here are some key differences:
The student does not use moveForward or move commands in the Else block. Instead, they use turnRight and turnLeft commands, which are not necessary in this task.
The student does not use RepeatUntil in the Else block at all. This is a critical mistake, as RepeatUntil is required to repeat the code until the avatar reaches the goal cell.
The student does not use goal as a condition in the If statement. Instead, they use pathRight, which is not a valid condition in this task.
Student's attempt code:
def Run(){
moveForward
If(pathAhead){
moveForward
}
Else{
turnLeft
turnRight
}
}

In summary, the student's attempt code for both tasks has some similarities, such as the use of moveForward and turnLeft commands. However, there are significant differences in how the RepeatUntil and If statements are used, which lead to errors in both tasks.
