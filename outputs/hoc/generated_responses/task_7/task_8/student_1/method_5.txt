You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathAhead){
			moveForward

		Else{
			turnLeft

}

--- Reference Task 1: Student attempt ---
def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathLeft){
			turnLeft
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathAhead){
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			turnRight
		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt inspired by their behavior and misconceptions in the reference task might be as follows:

def Run(){
	RepeatUntil(goal){
		If(pathLeft){
			turnLeft
			moveForward
		}
		Else{
			moveForward
		}
	}
}

In the reference task, the student misunderstood that the avatar has to turn left whenever there is a path on the left. This might cause issues in situations where the pathAhead is free but the pathLeft is also free. So, following the same misconceptions, they'd likely make the same mistake when dealing with the target task.
