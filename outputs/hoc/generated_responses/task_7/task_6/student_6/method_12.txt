You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 is incorrect because it does not take into account the possibility of encountering a wall. The student's code simply moves forward and turns left repeatedly, without checking if there is a wall in the way. This will result in the avatar crashing into a wall and not being able to reach the goal.

The student's misconceptions in this attempt are:

Not understanding the importance of checking for walls in the path.
Not using the pathAhead and pathLeft Boolean conditions to determine the availability of paths.
Not using the If statement to handle different scenarios and instead using a repetitive sequence of movements.
For the target task 1, the student's attempt is likely to be similar to the reference task 1 attempt, with the student neglecting to check for walls and simply moving forward and turning left repeatedly. The student may also not understand the importance of using the pathLeft condition to check for the availability of the left path.

The student's attempt for the target task 1 could be:




def Run(){
    RepeatUntil(goal){
        moveForward
        turnLeft
        moveForward
        turnLeft
    }
}
This attempt will also result in the avatar crashing into a wall and not being able to reach the goal, as the student has not taken into account the possibility of encountering a wall.
