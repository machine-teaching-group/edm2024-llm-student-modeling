You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

			turnLeft
			moveForward
		}
		Else{

		}
	}
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt code for the reference task 1 has several misconceptions and issues:

The student has not used any loops or conditionals, and has instead written a sequence of moves that will not solve the task.
The student has not checked for the AVATAR's location and direction, and has instead assumed that the AVATAR is always facing East.
The student has not checked for WALL cells, and has instead tried to move the AVATAR through WALL cells, which will cause the AVATAR to crash.
The student has not used the pathAhead and pathLeft Boolean conditions, which are necessary to check for the AVATAR's surroundings and determine the correct moves.
Based on these misconceptions, it is likely that the student will make similar mistakes in their attempt code for the target task 1. Here's a possible attempt code that the student might write:

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
def Run(){
moveForward
turnLeft
moveForward
moveForward
moveForward
moveForward
turnLeft
moveForward
moveForward
moveForward
moveForward
moveForward
moveForward
}

This attempt code has the same issues as the reference task 1 attempt code:

The student has not used any loops or conditionals, and has instead written a sequence of moves that will not solve the task.
The student has not checked for the AVATAR's location and direction, and has instead assumed that the AVATAR is always facing East.
The student has not checked for WALL cells, and has instead tried to move the AVATAR through WALL cells, which will cause the AVATAR to crash.
The student has not used the pathAhead and pathLeft Boolean conditions, which are necessary to check for the AVATAR's surroundings and determine the correct moves.
Therefore, the student's attempt code for the target task 1 will likely fail to solve the task, and will require corrections and improvements to address the misconceptions and issues mentioned above.
