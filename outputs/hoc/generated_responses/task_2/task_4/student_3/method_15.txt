You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

In this example, we can see that the student has made several attempts at the target task, but they have not yet successfully solved it. The student has demonstrated some common misconceptions and behaviors, such as:

* Moving forward twice in a row (lines 2-3)
* Turning left or right without moving forward first (lines 5-6, 8-9, 11-12)
* Not turning in the correct direction after moving forward (line 10)
* Not correctly using landmarks to determine which way to turn (lines 5-6, 8-9, 11-12)

The student's attempts show a lack of understanding of the grid structure and how to navigate it effectively. They also demonstrate a trial-and-error approach, rather than a thoughtful and planned strategy.

As a teacher, you could use this information to tailor
