You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 shows several misconceptions and misunderstandings. Here are some observations and explanations of the student's behavior:

Extra movements: The student has added extra moves, such as moving forward twice in a row, or turning left and right multiple times. This suggests that the student does not fully understand the instructions or the goal of the task.
Lack of spatial awareness: The student seems to have difficulty keeping track of the avatar's position and orientation. For example, they turn left and right repeatedly without considering the avatar's current direction. This indicates that the student needs to improve their spatial reasoning skills.
Inconsistent turns: The student sometimes turns in inconsistent directions, such as turning left after moving forward instead of turning right. This suggests that the student may not fully comprehend the concept of left and right turns.
Ignoring obstacles: The student attempts to move the avatar through walls (e.g., moving forward from cell 5), indicating that they do not fully understand the rules of the game.
Based on these observations, we can predict how the student might approach the target task 1. Here's a possible attempt code that reflects the student's behavior and misconceptions:

def Run(){
moveForward
turnLeft
moveForward
turnRight
turnRight
turnLeft
moveForward
turnLeft
turnRight
turnRight
turnLeft
turnLeft
moveForward
turnRight
moveForward
turnLeft
turnLeft
turnRight
turnRight
turnRight
turnRight
turnRight
turnLeft
turnLeft
moveForward
turnLeft
turnRight
turnRight
turnLeft
turnLeft
moveForward
}

In this attempt, the student continues to exhibit the same misconceptions and behaviors as in the reference task 1. They add unnecessary moves, fail to maintain consistent orientation, and ignore obstacles. Specifically:

Extra movements: The student still includes redundant moves, like moving forward twice in a row or turning left and right multiple times.
Lack of spatial awareness: The student demonstrates poor spatial reasoning, often turning in incorrect directions or failing to account for the avatar's current orientation.
Inconsistent turns: The student continues to make inconsistent turns, such as turning left after moving forward.
Ignoring obstacles: The student again attempts to move the avatar through walls, disregarding the game's rules.
By analyzing the student's behavior and misconceptions in the reference task 1, we can anticipate similar mistakes in their attempt at the target task 1.
