You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/. 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

The above code is a sample run for a robotics course where students have to write codes to control a robot's movements. The `Reference Task` shows a correct solution to move the robot from start to goal avoiding obstacles (WALLS). The `Student Attempt` shows how a student implemented the solution but made mistakes that caused the robot to crash into WALLS. Now a new `Target Task` is given, and the student's job is to implement a solution for this new task while avoiding the same mistakes they did in the first task.

In this case, the student's main mistake was not turning enough; they turned left when they should have turned right. Also, they moved forward too many times, which led to the robot crashing into a wall. To complete the target task without making the same mistake, the student must turn right instead of left and move forward only three times. The corrected code for the target task would look like this:
