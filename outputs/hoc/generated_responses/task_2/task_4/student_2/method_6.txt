You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

--- Target Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 is incorrect because it turns right instead of left after moving forward twice. This causes the avatar to move away from the goal instead of towards it.

The student attempt for the target task 1 is likely to be similar to the reference task attempt, with the student turning right instead of left after moving forward twice. However, this time the avatar will crash into the wall since there is no clear path to the goal.

Here's a possible attempt code that captures the student's behavior and misconceptions:

def Run(){
  moveForward
  turnRight
  moveForward
  turnLeft
  moveForward
}
Explanation:

The student correctly moves forward initially but then turns right instead of left. This is because they have misunderstood the instructions or haven't paid attention to the goal's location.
After moving forward again, the student turns left, which is correct, but it's too late now. The avatar has already moved away from the goal.
Finally, the student moves forward again, hoping to reach the goal, but it crashes into the wall since there's no clear path.
This attempt code demonstrates the student's misconception about the directions and their sequence, which leads to a wrong solution.
