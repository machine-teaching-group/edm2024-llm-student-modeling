You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

--- Target Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
In the reference task, the student's attempt code is as follows:

```
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
}
```

Let's analyze the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code:

1. **Correct Movements**: The student correctly used the `moveForward`, `turnLeft`, and `turnRight` blocks to navigate the maze.

2. **Incomplete Solution**: The student's code is incomplete as it doesn't lead the avatar to the goal in the reference task. It appears that the student stopped writing the code prematurely.

Now, let's synthesize an attempt code for the new target task, assuming the same student's behavior and misconceptions:

For the new target task, the grid looks like this:

```
1	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	
2	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	
3	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	
4	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	
5	#	#	#	v	#	#	#	#	#	#	
6	#	#	#	.	.	#	#	#	#	#	
7	#	#	#	#	+	#	#	#	#	#	
8	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	
9	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	
10	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	#	
```

Based on the student's previous attempt, we can anticipate their behavior for the new task:

```
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	# The student might stop writing the code here, as seen in the reference task attempt.
}
```

In this synthesized attempt, the student is expected to repeat their behavior from the reference task. They start by moving forward and then turning left and moving forward again. However, they might not complete the solution for the new task, resulting in an incomplete code.
