You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){

	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 has a few misconceptions and errors. Here are some observations:

The student has correctly moved forward twice and turned left once, but then they have missed the last move forward command before turning right. This indicates that the student might not fully understand the importance of the sequence of commands or the need to cover all possible paths.
The student has also missed the final move forward command after turning right, which would bring the avatar to the goal cell. Instead, they have terminated the program prematurely. This suggests that the student may not fully comprehend the logic behind the solution or how to ensure that the avatar reaches the goal.
Another potential issue with the student's approach is that they have not checked whether the avatar has reached the goal or not. In this case, even though the avatar has not reached the goal, the program would still terminate without any error message or indication that something went wrong.
Now, let's synthesize an attempt code for the target task 1 that reflects the student's behavior and misconceptions observed in their attempt for the reference task 1. Here's one possible implementation:

def Run(){
    moveForward
    turnLeft
    moveForward
    // Missing move forward command before turning right
    turnRight
    // Terminating the program prematurely
}
In this attempt, we have replicated the mistakes made by the student in the reference task 1. Specifically, we have missed the final move forward command before turning right and terminated the program early. We have also neglected to check whether the avatar has reached the goal or not. These errors should help us identify areas where the student needs more practice or guidance to improve their understanding of the programming concepts involved in solving these tasks.
