You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/. 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

In this task, we provide you with two grid environments. The first one represents the reference task, and the second represents the target task. Your goal is to analyze the student's behavior and misconceptions in the provided attempt code for the reference task and then synthesize an attempt code for the target task that reflects the same behavior and misconceptions.

The reference task has a simple solution that moves the avatar to the goal cell (marked with 'v') by moving forward three times and turning left twice. However, the student's attempt code only moves forward twice and turns left once, which will result in a wall collision. It seems like the student misunderstood the instructions or didn't fully understand the environment.

Now, imagine you are the student who wrote the attempt code for the reference task. Please write your attempt code for the target task, which should demonstrate the same behavior and misconceptions as your previous code.
