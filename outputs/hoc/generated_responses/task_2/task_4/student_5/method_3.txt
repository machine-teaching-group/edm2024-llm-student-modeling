You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/. 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

In this scenario, we have two tasks, the reference task, and the target task. The reference task has been solved correctly by the given student, but there's an error in their attempt code. Also, there's a target task with its own solution code. The goal is to write a probable attempt code that a student who made errors in the reference task would write for the target task. That means we need to capture how they think and what misconceptions they might have based on their previous work.

The reference task is a grid problem where the avatar needs to get to the goal (the '+' symbol) without hitting walls. The student's attempt code moves forward twice, turns left, moves forward again, and then turns right before moving forward once more to hit the goal. However, this doesn't work because after turning left, the avatar isn't facing the goal anymore, so moving forward would crash into the wall. The correct way is to turn right first before moving twice forward.

Now let's imagine that the student who wrote the reference task attempt code will also
