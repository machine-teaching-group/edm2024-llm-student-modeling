You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

--- Target Task 1: Solution ---
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 has a few misconceptions and errors.

The student has not turned right after moving forward three times, which is necessary to reach the goal cell.
The student has moved forward twice instead of once, which makes the avatar move past the goal cell.
The student has not included any conditionals or loops to check whether the avatar has reached the goal cell or not.
Based on these observations, we can predict how the student might approach the target task 1. Here's a possible attempt code that the student might write:

def Run(){
moveForward
turnLeft
moveForward
moveForward
}

The student has repeated the same mistake as in the reference task 1 by moving forward twice without checking whether the avatar has reached the goal cell. Also, they have not included any conditional statements to check whether the avatar has reached the goal cell or not. Therefore, the avatar will move past the goal cell, and the program will not terminate.
