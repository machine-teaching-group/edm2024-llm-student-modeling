You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

def Run(){

	turnRight
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Based on the reference task, its solution code, and the student's attempt, we can observe the following behaviors and misconceptions in the student's attempt:

1. **Movement Misconception**: The student seems to have a misconception about how to navigate the maze. In the reference solution, the AVATAR makes a sequence of moves, turns, and then moves again to reach the goal. However, in the student's attempt, the AVATAR is moving forward continuously without considering turns. This indicates that the student has not grasped the concept of turning to change the AVATAR's direction when needed.

2. **No Turning**: The student's code lacks any turn actions (turnLeft or turnRight). This suggests that the student may not understand the need for turning the AVATAR to navigate the maze correctly. They are assuming that moving forward multiple times in a row will lead to the goal, which is not the case.

Now, let's synthesize an attempt code for the new target task that captures the same student's behavior and misconceptions:

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---

```python
def Run(){
    moveForward
    moveForward
    moveForward
    moveForward
    moveForward
    moveForward
    moveForward
    moveForward
}
```

In this attempt code for the new target task, the student continues to exhibit the same misconception as in the reference task. They are attempting to move forward multiple times in a row without considering the need for turns. This code will not lead the AVATAR to the goal successfully because it does not account for the maze's layout and the requirement to make turns to navigate it.
