You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
In the reference task, we have a 10x10 grid where the AVATAR is represented by '>' and faces East. The goal cell is represented by '+', and there are walls represented by '#'. The reference solution code correctly navigates the AVATAR to the goal cell with the sequence: `moveForward`, `turnLeft`, `moveForward`, `turnRight`, `moveForward`.

Now, let's analyze the student's attempt in the reference task:

```python
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
	moveForward
}
```

The student's attempt begins correctly with `moveForward` and `turnLeft`, which matches the reference solution. However, the student then adds two consecutive `moveForward` commands instead of `turnRight` and then `moveForward`. This is where the misconception lies.

The misconceptions in the student's attempt can be summarized as follows:
1. Lack of Right Turn: The student fails to include a `turnRight` command after the initial movement and left turn. This leads to the AVATAR moving forward when it should be turning right.

Now, for the target task, we will synthesize an attempt code from the same student, considering their previous misconceptions. In the target task, the AVATAR faces South ('v') and needs to reach the goal cell ('+'). Let's create a student attempt that reflects the previous misconceptions:

```python
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward
	moveForward
}
```

In this synthesized student attempt for the target task, we can see that the student repeats the same misconception of adding two consecutive `moveForward` commands after the initial movement and right turn. This code would result in the AVATAR moving forward when it should be turning left.
