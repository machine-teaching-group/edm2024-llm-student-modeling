You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/. 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

In this task, we want you to analyze the provided reference task, solution code, and student attempt code. Then, based on the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code, write a new attempt code for a different but related task (target task). The new attempt code should capture the student's behavior and misconceptions as seen in the reference task.

Note that the reference task and target task have the same setup and rules. In both tasks, the avatar needs to move toward the goal cell (marked '.') by executing moves. A move consists of either moving forward or turning left/right. The avatar can only move into empty cells, and attempting to move into a wall cell will result in a crash.

Your submission should consist of two parts:

1. Explanation of the student's behavior and misconceptions in the reference task attempt code.
2. New attempt code for the target task, which captures the student's behavior and misconceptions as observed in the reference task.
