You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

	turnLeft

	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Based on the reference task, the student's attempt code shows some misconceptions and incorrect behavior. Here is a breakdown of the student's mistakes:

1. Redundant movements: The student attempts to moveForward multiple times consecutively without changing direction, which is unnecessary and inefficient.

2. Incorrect turning: The student incorrectly uses turnLeft and turnRight in some places. For example, they use turnLeft immediately followed by turnRight, which cancels out and does not change the direction. This indicates a lack of understanding of the correct turning actions needed to navigate the maze.

3. Overcomplicating turns: The student uses multiple turnLeft or turnRight actions in a row when a single turn would suffice. For example, they use turnLeft four times in a row, which is not necessary.

4. Lack of a clear strategy: The student's attempt code lacks a clear strategy for navigating the maze. They seem to be trying different combinations of movements and turns without a clear understanding of how to reach the goal.

5. Ignoring goal proximity: The student does not take into account the presence of the goal cell in their attempt code. They do not include any logic or conditions to check if they have reached the goal or to stop the movement when the goal is reached.

Based on this analysis, let's synthesize an attempt code for the new target task that captures the student's behavior and misconceptions:

}

This synthesized attempt code reflects the student's tendencies to overcomplicate movements, make redundant actions, and lack a clear strategy.
