You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

	turnLeft
	moveForward
}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
Based on the provided information, it seems that the student in the reference task attempted to solve the maze challenge but made some misconceptions and errors in their code. Let's analyze their attempt:

Reference Task 1: Student Attempt
```python
def Run(){
	moveForward
	turnRight
	turnLeft
	turnRight
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	turnLeft
	turnRight
	moveForward
}
```

Misconceptions and Errors in the Student's Attempt:

1. **Inefficient Movements**: The student's code contains unnecessary and inefficient movements. For example, there are several consecutive turns (turnRight, turnLeft, turnRight, turnLeft) that cancel each other out, achieving nothing.

2. **Repetitive Turns**: The student uses consecutive turnLeft and turnRight blocks, which result in the avatar facing the same direction as before. These turns do not contribute to the progress toward the goal.

3. **Overuse of Turns**: The student uses a lot of turn blocks without checking the direction they need to face. In maze-solving, it's essential to use turns strategically only when needed.

4. **Lack of Goal-Oriented Movements**: The code lacks a clear strategy for reaching the goal. It doesn't take into account the position of the goal or the obstacles in the maze.

Now, let's create a student's attempt for the new target task, attempting to capture the same student's behavior and misconceptions:

Target Task 1: Student Attempt (Simulating the Same Student's Behavior)

```python
def Run(){
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnRight
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	turnRight
	moveForward
	moveForward
	moveForward
	turnLeft
	moveForward
}
```

In this simulated student attempt, we can see that the same misconceptions and errors are replicated. The student still uses unnecessary turns, inefficient movements, and lacks a goal-oriented approach to solving the maze.
