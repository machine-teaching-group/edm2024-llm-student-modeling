You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/ 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

}

--- Target Task 1: Student attempt ---
The student attempt for the reference task 1 is incorrect because it turns right instead of left after moving forward twice. This causes the avatar to move away from the goal instead of towards it.

The student attempt for the target task 1 is likely to be similar to the reference task 1 attempt, with the student turning right instead of left after moving forward twice. However, since the target task has a different layout, the student may also make additional mistakes such as moving forward too many times or not enough, or turning in the wrong direction at some point.

Here's an example of what the student attempt for the target task 1 might look like:

def Run(){
    turnRight
    moveForward
    moveForward
    turnLeft
    moveForward
    moveForward
    turnRight
    moveForward
}
In this attempt, the student correctly turns right initially, but then moves forward two times too many, causing the avatar to overshoot the goal. Then, they turn left and move forward again, which puts them back on track somewhat, but still not quite correct. Finally, they turn right again and move forward once more, which leads to a wall and crashes the avatar.
