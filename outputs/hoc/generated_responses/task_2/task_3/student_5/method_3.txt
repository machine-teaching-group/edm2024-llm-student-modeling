You are working on the visual programming domain Classic Maze Challenge from https://code.org/. 
In this domain, the following types of coding blocks are available.
- Basic navigation blocks: moveForward, turnLeft, turnRight.
- Boolean conditions: pathAhead, pathLeft, pathRight, goal
- Loops: RepeatUntil(boolean){}
- Conditionals: If(boolean){}, If(boolean){}Else{}.

A task is represented as a 10x10 visual grid.
This grid contains WALL cells, FREE cells, a GOAL cell, and an AVATAR (with specific location and direction).
We represent a task's 10x10 visual grid with the following symbols.
'#' represents a WALL cell.
'+' represents the GOAL cell.
'>' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing East direction.
'<' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing West direction.
'^' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing North direction.
'v' represents AVATAR's location on a cell, facing South direction.
A solution code for a task brings the AVATAR to the GOAL when executed. Note that the AVATAR can only move between FREE cells and will crash if it tries to go to a WALL cell.

First, I give you below a reference task, its solution code, and an attempt code from a student on the reference task. Observe and explain the student's behavior and misconceptions in the attempt code.

Second, I give you a new target task with its solution code. You are going to play the role of the given student. Synthesize an attempt code that is likely to be written by the same student, i.e capturing the student's behavior and misconceptions shown on the reference task.

The above code is trying to solve a grid-based problem where the agent can move forward and turn. The reference task has the agent moving toward a goal cell (denoted by ".") while avoiding walls ("#"). The student's attempt code moves twice without turning, hence crashing into the wall.

The second part asks me to synthesize a new attempt code for another similar task (target task) based on how the student solved the reference task. The target task has a longer path to the goal and requires more turns. The attempt code will likely have the agent moving forward thrice without turning, thus hitting the wall again.

Please let me know if there's anything else you need help with.
